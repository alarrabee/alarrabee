Hi, I'm Alex Larrabee. I'm from Minnesota and live in Minneapolis. I am an experienced scientist transitioning to software development.

I am a graduate of the University of Minnesota's Full-stack Coding Bootcamp.
My background includes a B.S in Chemistry with a minor in Biochemistry. I work in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. I help build innovative and life saving technology.

Things I do when I'm not coding\
🍅 Tending to my farm in Stardew Valley\
🔮 Collecting enamel pins\
🍵 Enjoying tea from my amateur tea collection.\
⌚ Following the Weevil subreddit wondering what time it is\
🐉 Trying to keep my D&D players from asking the shop keep for the 20th time if he is absolutely sure he's not a horse
